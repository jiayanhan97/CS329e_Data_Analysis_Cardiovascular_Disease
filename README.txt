SH baseline dataset_dataverse.csv - The original dataset that we used. There will be several other datasets generated for feature engineering as the program proceeds

final-cvd.ipynd - we tried to predict if a person has high risk of cardiovascular disease based on the features. we have two models in this jupyter notebook file. First model is with the dominating features and the second model is without the dominating features. 

1. do you guys expect to see the actual darwin code in our presentation
2. learning: about the improvement of darwin package?
3. analyze the result
	1) sbp(recurrent contraction) dbp (recurrent expansion)are the most important features that can explain nearly 85% of the variation, so we have another 
	I'm thinking that we could utilize the cost matrix to show possible savings that can be generated by using our model to predict high risk cardiovascular disease,
